                <p> I aspire to learn as many skills as I can in software development, followed by business administration. My
                    personal obligation is to contribute to the future of computer functionality and technology algorithms
                    by applying the concepts I’ve cultivated overtime.
                </p>
                <p> Although a day in my life really varies, you’ll usually find me hard at work studying Swift, Python, or JavaScript
                    among other languages and libraries so that I can one day dedicate all of my time to achieving my goals
                    and passions becoming a professional software developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If I had all the money I needed, I would rent out a small apartment in San Fransisco right next to my chosen office, wake
                    up early in the morning each day of the week, and work on any exciting new project that I’ll have invested
                    myself into at the time. What I desire most is a lifestyle revolving around deep working ethics and focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favourite past times are:
                    <ul>

                        <li>Reading non-fiction titles</li>
                        <li>Teaching myself new and advanced computer science-related topics (e.g. neural networks, machine learning,
                            optimization, lambda calculus
                        </li>
                        <li>Meditation and yoga</li>
